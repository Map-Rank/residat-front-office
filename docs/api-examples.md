## API Integration ü§ù

 <a href="https://dev.residat.com/community">RESIDAT</a> leverages Axios for seamless interaction with backend services, encapsulated within a structured approach to handle different types of API requests. The core functionality revolves around three custom functions designed to streamline the process of making API calls:

### Configuring Axios

The Axios instance is configured with a base URL, sourced from an environment variable, ensuring all API requests are directed to the correct server endpoint. This configuration is essential for both development and production environments.

### API Call Functions

- **`makeApiPostCall`**: Used for creating or updating resources. It supports JSON and multipart/form-data, making it versatile for submissions including text and media.
- **`makeApiGetCall`**: Retrieves data from the server. It's used extensively across the application to fetch posts, user profiles, and climate data.
- **`makeApiDeleteCall`**: Removes resources identified by a specific endpoint, essential for deleting posts or other user-generated content.

### Authentication and Headers

All requests are authenticated using Bearer tokens, with the `Authorization` header carrying the token. The `Content-Type` header is dynamically set based on the request content.

### Detailed Use Cases

#### Creating a Post

To create a post, especially with media, `makeApiPostCall` is used:

- **Code Snippet File  Path**: `src/features/Post/services/postService.js`
```javascript
    const createPost = async (postData) => {
    const authToken = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    const formData = new FormData();

    // Append post details to formData
    formData.append('content', postData.content);
    formData.append('published_at', new Date().toISOString());
    postData.images.forEach((image, index) => {
        formData.append(`media[${index}]`, image, image.name);
    });

    // Make API call
    const response = await makeApiPostCall(API_ENDPOINTS.createPost, formData, authToken, true);
    return response.data;
    };
```

#### Fetching Posts

Retrieving posts utilizes, `makeApiGetCall` is used:


- **Code Snippet File  Path**: `src/features/Post/services/postService.js`
```javascript
  const getPosts = async () => {
      const authToken = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
  const response = await makeApiGetCall(API_ENDPOINTS.getPosts, authToken);
  return response.data.posts;
};
```

#### Deleting Posts

To delet a specific post , `makeApiDeleteCall` is used:

- **Code Snippet File  Path**: `src/features/Post/services/postService.js`
```javascript
const deletePost = async (postId) => {
    const authToken = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
  await makeApiDeleteCall(`${API_ENDPOINTS.deletePost}/${postId}`, authToken);
};

```

### Conclusion
Through these tailored functions,  <a href="https://dev.residat.com/community">RESIDAT</a> ensures secure, efficient, and clear API interactions, supporting the platform's functionality from content management to user engagement.



## Services üì°

In  <a href="https://dev.residat.com/community">RESIDAT</a>, services are crucial for abstracting the logic required to communicate with the backend API. They encapsulate the Axios API calls, providing a clean and reusable interface for the rest of the application to interact with the backend. Here's an overview of how services are structured and utilized:

### Structure

Services are organized under the `src/services` directory, with each service module corresponding to a specific domain or functionality within the application, such as posts, users, sectors, and zones. This modular approach ensures clear separation of concerns and enhances maintainability.

### Key Services

- **Zone Service**: Manages operations related to geographic zones, such as retrieving zone information based on specific criteria.

```javascript
// src/services/zoneService.js
import { makeApiGetCall } from '@/api';
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '@/constants';

const getZones = async (level_id, parent_id) => { /* Implementation */ };
export { getZones };
```

- **Post Service**: Handles creating, fetching, updating, and deleting posts. It utilizes multipart form data for posts that include media.

```javascript
// src/services/postService.js
import { makeApiPostCall, makeApiGetCall, makeApiDeleteCall } from '@/api';
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '@/constants';

const createPost = async (postData) => { /* Implementation */ };
const getPosts = async () => { /* Implementation */ };
// Additional post-related functions...
export { createPost, getPosts, /* other exports */ };
```

- **Sector Service**: Retrieves sector information, crucial for categorizing posts and user interests.

```javascript
// src/services/sectorService.js
import { makeApiGetCall } from '@/api';
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '@/constants';

const getSectors = async () => { /* Implementation */ };
export { getSectors };
```

### Usage

Services are invoked from Vue components or store actions to perform data operations. By centralizing API calls within services, we achieve a DRY codebase and simplify the process of updating or extending API interactions.

### Authentication

Most service functions require an authentication token, which is managed globally and passed as a parameter to ensure secure access to user-specific data and operations.

### Error Handling

Services are designed to handle errors gracefully, either logging them for developers or throwing them to be caught by calling components, allowing for user-friendly error messages.
