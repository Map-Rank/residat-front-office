## Introduction üåü

[RESIDAT](https://dev.residat.com/community) is a digital platform designed to enhance community resilience by providing access to climate risk information in Cameroon. It leverages spatial data and citizen science reports to visualize climate risks through interactive GIS dashboards. The platform offers a suite of features including:

- Visualization Dashboards: Interactive maps and graphs for understanding local climate risks and stakeholder activities.
- Community Intelligence: A repository for stakeholders to publish, manage, and interact with climate adaptation reports.
- Community Chat Rooms: Spaces for real-time discussion and exchange of climate-related information and services.

[RESIDAT](https://dev.residat.com/community) serves as a critical tool for local and regional climate authoritative bodies to send out mobile notifications and engage communities in proactive climate risk management.

## Context üí°

[RESIDAT](https://dev.residat.com/community) was born from the necessity to mitigate climate risks for communities in Cameroon. It targets the heart of climate vulnerability by providing critical, actionable data through GIS visualizations and real-time reports. The platform's goal is to empower communities and authorities to make informed decisions, enabling proactive and collaborative efforts towards climate resilience. In the face of increasing climate challenges, [RESIDAT](https://dev.residat.com/community) stands as a beacon of innovation and solidarity.
