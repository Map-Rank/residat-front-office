## Testing üß™

Testing is a crucial aspect of the development process, ensuring that the code is robust and behaves as expected. In the Residat project, we employ Vitest for our testing framework, providing an efficient and feature-rich environment for both unit and integration testing. Below is a summary of the current test coverage and details about the testing setup and examples.

### Test Coverage Summary

<!-- <img src="public\assets\images\Documentation\couverageView.jpeg"></img> -->

The test coverage report provides valuable insight into the robustness of our test suite. Here's a brief overview:

- **Overall Coverage**: Approximately 58.67% of statements and 69.58% of branches are covered by tests.
- **Components**: Some components like `EventAlertBox` and `IconWithLabel` have 100% statement coverage, which is excellent. However, other areas like the `src/assets` and `src/plugins` have 0% coverage, indicating potential areas for improvement.
- **Features**: The `SocialProfile` feature has substantial testing with over 96% coverage in some parts, but the `Report` feature has no tests yet.
- **Services and Stores**: The services have about 33% coverage, while the stores are at 26.31%, suggesting that state management testing could be enhanced.
